Various code I wrote during my role as a molecular ecologist


## Sim_Binary_PCR_Amp.R
Function to simulate the binary amplification of qPCR technical replicates for a given sample when only amplification frequency or sum of amplifications are given. Useful when conducting occupancy modelling for qPCR environmental DNA data as many programs require the amplification status of each individual technical replicate.
